    #   The test downloads two bands and extract one quality indicator from a
    #   single locale LST product (MOD11A2, Newfoundland), without any
    #   additional preprocessing operation. Output files are in GeoTiff format.

    #   The test works on the same local product of test 1, performing geometric
    #   operations (clipping on the extent of Avalon peninsula and resampling
    #   resolution to 1000m. Output files are in ENVI format.

    #   (Barbellino, Orobie Alps) and creates two defined spectral indices
    #   (NDVI and SAVI) and one custom index (GVMI). Geometric operations are
    #   performed like in test 2 (with a resampling to 250m resolution using
    #   mode), and processing options for time series creation are applied.
    #   Output files are in GeoTiff compressed format, with vrt time series.

    #   This test downloads two snow cover products (MYD10CM) of 1st August of
    #   years 2015 and 2016, applying geometric operations (clipping on Svalbard
    #   islands and reprojecting in Arctic Polar Stereographic projection).

    #   in a clipped overlapping area (Minorca island).
