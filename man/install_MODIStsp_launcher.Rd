install_MODIStsp_launcher(bin_dir = NA, desktop_dir = NA,
  desktop_shortcut = TRUE, sudo = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{bin_dir}{in Linux, directory in which the link to the bash script should be placed (default: /usr/bin; a path included in the PATH
environment variable is suggested); in Windows, directory where to place the menu entry in the Start Menu (default: Start Menu -> Programs -> MODIStsp).}

\item{desktop_dir}{if desktop_shortcut=TRUE: in Linux, directory in which the desktop entry should be placed (default: /usr/share/applications);

\description{
Function which allows to use MODIStsp in batch mode by creating links
}
\details{
MODIStsp tool can be used also as a standalone tool my launching a bash/batch script, which is stored in the function files.
In order to simply retrieve it, this function will create a desktop entry and a symbolic link to the bash script (in Linux)
or a link in the Start Menu to the batch script (in Windows).
Note that, if the packages MODIStsp is installed in a directory version-dependent (as the default one is), this function should be rerunned after
an R upgrade, otherwise the links would continue to point to the old package version!
